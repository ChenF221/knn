# knn
This Python code is a simple machine learning script that performs classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm

Imports: The code imports necessary libraries including NumPy, Matplotlib, pandas, and the KNeighborsClassifier from scikit-learn.

Data Loading: It loads a dataset from a CSV file named "countries.csv" into a pandas DataFrame (df).

Data Preparation: It separates the features (X) and the target variable (y) from the DataFrame.

Visualization: It creates a 3D scatter plot to visualize the data points based on the three features: "Life Expectancy", "GDP Per Capita", and "CO2 Emissions Per Capita". Different classes are represented by different colors.

User Input: It prompts the user to input values for "Life Expectancy", "GDP Per Capita", and "CO2 Emissions Per Capita" for a new data point (dfp).

Model Training: It initializes a KNN classifier with a user-defined number of neighbors (k), fits the model to the training data (X, y).

Prediction: It predicts the class of the new data point (dfp) using the trained KNN model.

Output: It prints the predicted class of the new data point.

Visualization: It displays the new data point on the 3D scatter plot along with a marker to represent the predicted class.

User Input for K: It prompts the user to input the value of k (number of neighbors) for the KNN algorithm.

Overall, this script demonstrates a simple application of KNN for classification and provides a visual representation of the classification results in a 3D space.
